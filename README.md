# Game Store Demo

This project is a simple **Game Store** application built using **ASP.NET MVC** with **.NET Framework 8.0**. It demonstrates core functionality through **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing game data.

## Features
- Add, update, and delete games from the store inventory.
- Apply best practices in software development, including:
  - **Code linting** to maintain code quality and readability.
  - **Naming conventions** to ensure consistency and clarity.
  - **Separation of concerns** for better code maintainability.
  - Use of **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture to organize the application efficiently.
  
## Learning & Implementation
This demo was built as part of an **online course**, where I applied best practices to improve my skills as a software engineer. The focus was on implementing clean, maintainable, and scalable code while following professional software development methodologies.

## Requirements
- **.NET 8.0** is required to run the application.
- **SQL Server** is used for the database, so make sure to configure it appropriately in your environment.
